## FluentStream Challenge

### README

This is a React web application that allows users to add new beers to a cooler,
and like or dislike a specific beer. I chose to use Redux for state management,
which allows the user to have a seamless user experience without having to deal
with constant re-rendering of the page.

* To run this application you MUST run a proxy
 * RECOMMENDED PROXY: `git clone https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere.git`
 * Navigate to proxy directory and run `npm install && npm start` in your terminal.
 * You should now be running CORS Anywhere on `localhost:8080`
 * Once you have CORS Anywhere up and running you can `git clone https://github.com/tjkomor/fs-challenge.git`
 * Navigate to the fs-challenge directory and run `npm install && npm start`
 * You should now see the React application running on `localhost:3000` in your browser.
 * Have fun ðŸ˜¬
